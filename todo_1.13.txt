1.13 TODOS
- Custom Conversions:
    - Read from datapack instead of config
    - Allow defaults to be overrided from datapacks
    - Merge jsons from different datapacks (option to replace)
    - Remove meta from "<id>|<meta>" NSS specifier
    - Add "TAG|<tag>" NSS specifier
    - Remove wildcard mapper
    - Cleanup format
        - Remove "o", "i", "c" shortcut keys, they just clutter up parsing logic and don't make jsons that much shorter
        - Remove repeated ingredient specifier format, force map all the time (?)
- Flattening:
    - Items:
        - alchbags/klein stars/fuels/covalence dust/matter: split
        - single toggle rings with meta: move to NBT
    - Blocks:
        - rm/dm furnace: combine lit/unlit
        - dm pedestal: update copying from blocknote (redstone to blockstate prop?)
        - matterblocks/fuelblocks: split
